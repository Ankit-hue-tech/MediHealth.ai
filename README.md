# 🛡 MediHealth.ai

An AI-powered web application to detect **fake and misleading health messages** commonly spread on **WhatsApp, Instagram, and social media platforms**.

---

##  Problem Statement

Fake health advice spreads rapidly on social media, leading to:
- Dangerous self-medication
- Delayed medical treatment

Most users cannot easily verify whether a forwarded message is trustworthy.

**MediHealth.ai** analyzes health-related messages and provides:
-  Misinformation risk score
-  Clear verdict (Safe / Misleading / High Risk)

Instead of just answering questions, it **prevents the spread of misinformation**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User pastes a health message (WhatsApp / Instagram forward).
